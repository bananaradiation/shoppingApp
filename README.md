## Project for CSE135: Online Analyrics Applications (spring 2014)
### Team members: Hannah Chen, Michael Yokoi


The overall goal is to build a shopping application in JSP with postgres SQL database and Tomcat app server and is implemented in four phases. 

1. Phase one consisted of creating the transaction portion of the app: signup; login; product and category pages (for owners), browsing and order pages (for customers). This required understanding of querying with prepared statements, session management, calling/passing parameters and basic html.

2. Phase two deals with providing analytics measures and performance tuning through use of efficient querying/jsp as well as experimentation.
